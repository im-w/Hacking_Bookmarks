# Attack Phase Description
---
---
- -
-

1. Reconnaissance: Researching, identifying and selecting targets using active or passive reconnaissance.

2. Resource Development: Preparatory activities aimed at setting up the infrastructure required for the attack.

3. Delivery: Techniques resulting in the transmission of a weaponized object to the targeted environment.

4. Social Engineering: Techniques aimed at the manipulation of people to perform unsafe actions.

5. Exploitation: Techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in systems that may, amongst others, result in code execution.

6. Persistence: Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence on the system.

7. Defense Evasion: Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.

8. Command & Control: Techniques that allow attackers to communicate with controlled systems within a target network.

9. Pivoting: Tunneling traffic through a controlled system to other systems that are not directly accessible.

10. Discovery: Techniques that allow an attacker to gain knowledge about a system and its network environment.

11. Privilege Escalation: The result of techniques that provide an attacker with higher permissions on a system or network.

13. Credential Access: Techniques resulting in the access of, or control over, system, service or domain credentials.

14. Lateral Movement: Techniques that enable an adversary to horizontally access and control other remote systems.

15. Collection: Techniques used to identify and gather data from a target network prior to exfiltration.

16. Exfiltration: Techniques that result or aid in an attacker removing data from a target network.

17. Impact: Techniques aimed at manipulating, interrupting or destroying the target system or data.

### *ChatGPT Quary*

`I need a list of 20 key usage keywords for each bookmarked website found in a Chrome bookmark HTML file. The keywords should be formatted as usage1 | usage2 | usage3 | ... | usage20. If you cannot identify additional usages for a particular site, please skip writing the usages for that site. 
focus on cyber security keywords when you want find usage of that site if you cant find any cyber security keyword write general usage of that site
and after finding key words try to figure out what attack parse that is use full in thatunified kill chain attack parse table`

### *Model Hallucination*

**Model hallucination** refers to the phenomenon where a machine learning model generates outputs that are incorrect, misleading, or nonsensical, despite sounding plausible. This can occur due to biases in the training data or limitations in the model's understanding, leading it to "imagine" information that doesn’t exist.

**Examples of model hallucination include:**

1. **Text Generation**: A language model may create a fictional historical event or person that sounds credible but lacks any basis in reality.

2. **Image Recognition**: An AI might misidentify an object, such as interpreting a picture of a cat as a dog, or even generating a completely fictitious creature.

3. **Chatbots**: A chatbot might confidently assert incorrect facts, like claiming a celebrity has won an award they never received.

4. **Medical Diagnosis**: An AI system could suggest treatments for conditions that do not exist, leading to potential misinformation.

These examples highlight how model hallucination can result in inaccuracies across various applications.
